### The origin of the eight and allusions of the class hall

Mr. Liu Yaoming, the founder, studied martial arts as a young man. He was deeply instructed by Master Guan Dexing, a famous martial arts senior in Cantonese opera, and participated in the eight-year work of anti-Japanese rescue with Master Guan. With the experience accumulated in the treatment of knife injuries in the career of Cantonese opera martial arts, "Banzhong Bahetang (Hong Kong) Co., Ltd." was founded in 1941, which has developed from a small workshop into a limited company of a certain scale. Now "Emergency Huatuo Oil" of "Banzhong Bahetang" is in Hong Kong and many countries around the world. It is the best-selling traditional Chinese medicine oil.
